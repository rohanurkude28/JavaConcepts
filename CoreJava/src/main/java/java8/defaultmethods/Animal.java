/**
Simplest answer is to enable the functionality of lambda expression in java. Lambda expression are essentially of type of functional interface. To support lambda expressions seamlessly, all core classes have to be modified. But these core classes like java.util.List are implemented not only in JDK classes, but also in thousands of client code as well. Any incompatible change in core classes will back fire for sure and will not be accepted at all.
Default methods break this deadlock and allow adding support for functional interface in core classes. Letâ€™s see an example. Below is a method which has been added to java.lang.Iterable.
default void forEach(Consumer<? super T> action) {
    Objects.requireNonNull(action);
    for (T t : this) {
        action.accept(t);
    }
}
